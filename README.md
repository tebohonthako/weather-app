# weather-app

Built the front-end UI of a weather app as mySheCodes bootcamp homework using HTML and CSS. 
Learnt how to inject CSS into HTML using <style> tag inside tag. 
Used classes inside HTML elements to target the CSS selectors for styling of my page.
The use of emojis was really fun and added some character to myweather page.
